# What this doing?
After done some Python and C progamming courses, I'm trying to do shits combining the Python and C language.
In this project , I'm trying to using C to write some libs like ‘Caesar cipher‘ ， and using python to do the test.

# Complie and test
This project is intend to run on Linux, so the Python code will act like a shell script, with '#!/usr/bin/env python3' shebang.
