# What this doing?
After done some Python and C progamming courses, I'm trying to do shits combining the Python and C language.
In this project , I'm trying to using C to write some libs like ‘Caesar cipher‘ ， and using python to do the test.

# Complie and test
This project is intend to run on Linux, using gcc-13-x86-64-linux-gnu and Python 3.12.3.
There will be a shell script to make .so lib and run a python unnit test script to test the C code.

# Project Plan
First it will be build in Python, run with CLI.
Then C will take some core work, at that time, add specif argument to run with C lib.
Finnally the C lib can be edited like a plug-in to make the whole program more possible functions.
